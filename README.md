# MY DOTFILES
These are my own personal dotfiles that I am using currently. They were originally made on Arch with x11 in mind, though they have evolved over time and I've swapped to Wayland. I use this system for working on whatever projects I have as well as gaming. This is the only dotfiles repository I have, so it is subject to constant change.

## THINGS TO KNOW

## INSTRUCTIONS
The following are instructions for using these dotfiles on a fresh install of Arch.
1. ```sudo pacman -S git```
2. ```git clone https://github.com/qaffe/dotfiles.git```
3. ```cd dotfiles```
4. ```sudo bash post-install.sh``` - this script will only fully work if your username is qaffe and i don't feel like remaking that part of it
5. ```stow .```
