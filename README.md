# MY DOTFILES
These are my own personal dotfiles that I am using currently. They were originally made on Arch with x11 in mind, though I may switch to Wayland in the future. I use this system for working on whatever projects I have as well as gaming. This is the only dotfiles repository I have, so it is subject to constant change.
