# MY DOTFILES
These are my own personal dotfiles that I am using currently. They were originally made on Arch with x11 in mind, though I may switch to Wayland in the future. I use this system for working on whatever projects I have as well as gaming. This is the only dotfiles repository I have, so it is subject to constant change.

## THINGS TO KNOW
- This repo is WIP

## REQUIREMENTS
Please ensure you have the following installed on your system prior to attempting to use these dotfiles:
- X11
- BSPWM
- Zsh
- Git
- GNU Stow (Optional, but it's what I'm using to manage them)

## SCREENSHOTS
