# MY DOTFILES
These are my own personal dotfiles that I am using currently. They were originally made on Arch with x11 in mind, though they have evolved over time and I've swapped to Wayland. I use this system for working on whatever projects I have as well as gaming. This is the only dotfiles repository I have, so it is subject to constant change.

## THINGS TO KNOW
- This repo is WIP
- Put pacman.conf in /etc/pacman.conf (ignore if you're not using arch)
